# UI-UX-Internship-Tasks
During my UI/UX internship, I designed a simple mobile app signup flow, a clear and responsive newsletter layout, a user-friendly food order app with easy navigation, and an e-commerce app focused on smooth product browsing and checkout. Each design aimed to enhance the overall user experience.
